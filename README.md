# SchoolWork
School programming tasks including implementations of popular machine learning models, common computer vision techniques, artificial intelligence algorithms and big data tasks.

All code has been written in Python 3.7. The best way to run any of the code (with the exception of the AI algorithms) is to use a Jupyter Notebook and install the necessary Python libraries, which are always imported at the start of each file.
